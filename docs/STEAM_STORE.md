# Steam Store: CyberLab - The Ultimate Cybersecurity Simulator

## Short Description
The grid is real. Enter the most advanced cybersecurity simulation ever created. Use a **real Linux terminal** to bridge into isolated sandboxes, bypass real security layers, and master the art of cyber-warfare. For PC, built on Unreal Engine 5.

## About This Game
**CyberLab** is not just a game; it's a gateway. You play as an elite operative navigating a noir-cyberpunk world where data is the only currency that matters. 

### THE REVOLUTION: REAL COMMANDS, REAL CONSEQUENCES
Forget "hacking mini-games". CyberLab uses a custom-built PTY engine that connects your in-game terminal to real, isolated Linux environments. Every `ls`, `cat`, and `nmap` you type is executed by a real kernel.

### KEY FEATURES:
- **30+ High-Stakes Missions**: From silent infiltration to frantic Blue-Team defense.
- **Deep Progression**: Earn credits, upgrade your rig's CPU, RAM, and storage to handle complex exploits.
- **Moral Choice System**: Go White-Hat for corporate stability, or risk it all as a Black-Hat for the ultimate payday.
- **Atmospheric World**: A gritty, rain-soaked office that evolves as you climb the ranks.
